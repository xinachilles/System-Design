quad tree



[[Quadtrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) are a data structure that encode the who earth into a two-dimensional space with multiple cells.]{.mark}



[every non-leaf node has exactly four children.]{.mark}



In the context of location, these nodes represent the four quadrants: NW, NE, SW, and SE.



Each node in a quadtree can be recursively subdivided, with ~~successive subdivisions~~ resulting in smaller and smaller cells.



the idea is take the space and section into 4, 4 section, quad, and each section, could be sectioned into 4, and again each section can be into 4...





[Each point of interest should be in one cell and each cell can be present by a code]{.mark}

Each cell has limitation, if any cell reach the limitation the cell will be subdivided into smeller and smaller cell





We use 0 for left , 1 for right, 0 for top and 1 for bottom





Level 1 of quad tree should have 4 cells and his their code

00 -- top left,

01 -- top right,

10 -- bottom left

11 -- bottom right



Each level has 2 more digital compared with his upper level



0101 --- 0100, 0110, 0111 maybe also have 0001 from the his left section ,











the running time will reduce from n2 n square, to nlogn, if we want to check one given area, it just need long n time



~~wouldn't you have to restructure the quadtree every time ,an object moves and~~

~~in fact the answer to that question is absolutely 100% yes,~~





take all the point in the map and insert into the quadtree

Don't store the objects itself in the quadtree. Put them into a flat structure (array, linked list, etc.) and have the Quadtree just keep a pointer to the actual objects. If the quadtree has a certain depth (on all nodes), you could flatten it as well.
