1. **Partial GET Requests**
   - Useful for handling large resources like images
   - Example shows using Range header to request specific byte ranges
   - Can include HATEOAS links to point to other resources

I'll explain HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) with a practical example.

Let's say we have a REST API for a product catalog. Here's how a HATEOAS response might look:

```json
{
    "id": "123",
    "name": "Smartphone X",
    "price": 999.99,
    "inStock": true,
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "/api/v1/products/123"
        },
        "category": {
            "href": "/api/v1/categories/electronics"
        },
        "reviews": {
            "href": "/api/v1/products/123/reviews"
        },
        "addToCart": {
            "href": "/api/v1/cart",
            "method": "POST"
        },
        "relatedProducts": {
            "href": "/api/v1/products/123/related"
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
1. The response includes not just the product data, but also relevant links to related resources
2. Each link tells the client:
   - Where to find related resources (`href`)
   - What HTTP method to use (`method`)
   - What the link represents (through the key name)

Benefits of HATEOAS:
- Clients don't need to know the API structure in advance
- The API can evolve without breaking clients
- Clients can discover available actions dynamically
- Reduces coupling between client and server

This is particularly useful in scenarios like:
- Pagination (next/previous page links)
- Related resources
- Available actions for a resource
- State transitions in a workflow

The key idea is that the API response itself tells the client what it can do next, rather than the client having to know all the possible endpoints in advance.


2. **API Versioning Options**
   - Can be implemented in URLs (e.g., /v2/...)
   - Can be handled through API gateways/routers
   - Can be specified as parameters

3. **API Types Comparison**
   - REST APIs
     - Better for client-side applications
     - Compatible with browsers and mobile apps
     - Uses HTTP protocol
   - RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
     - More efficient for backend services
     - Often uses custom protocols instead of HTTP
     - Supports binary serialization
     - Better performance than HTTP-based REST

4. **API Gateway Features**
   - Acts as middleware between clients and API services
   - Key functionalities:
     - User identification
     - SSL offloading
     - Request routing
     - Rate limiting
     - Request aggregation (combining multiple services)
     - Can host additional functionality like user authentication

This document appears to be a collection of notes about API design considerations, focusing on practical aspects of implementing and optimizing APIs for different use cases.
