CDNs are a kind of cache that store large amounts of photo or media, vedio. In a typical CDN setup, a request will first ask the CDN for a piece of static media; the CDN will serve that content if it has it locally available. If it isn't available, the CDN will query the back-end servers for the file and then cache it locally and serve it to the requesting user.
