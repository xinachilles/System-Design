![CodeWhisperer prioritizes secure coding and responsible Artificial Intelligence (responsible Al) practices. It's optimized for Amazon APIs, trained extensively on Amazon and open-source code. You have the option of accepting the first suggestion, exploring more suggestions, or continuing writing your own code. It's important to review each code suggestion before accepting them, as you may need to make edits to ensure they align with your intended functionality. Security Scan The security scanning feature of Amazon CodeWhisperer detects security vulnerabilities in both generated and developer-written code. It scans the code to identify potential vulnerabilities and provides suggestions for remediation. This includes scanning for hard-to-find vulnerabilities that may be overlooked. ](../../../media/AWS-DevOps-Module-3-12-Code-Whisper-image3.png)
