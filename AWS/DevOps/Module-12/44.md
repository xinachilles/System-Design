Summary

AWS offers several tools for achieving comprehensive observability, including CloudWatch for monitoring and metrics, CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and analysis, AWS X-Ray for tracing applications, and App Mesh for managing complex service communication.

Facts

- CloudWatch:
  - Covers monitoring and provides metrics and alarms.
  - Offers default metrics for various AWS services and allows enabling detailed monitoring for more granular data.
  - Provides features like graphs, alarms, and metric math for data analysis and decision-making.
- CloudWatch Logs:
  - Handles log streaming and events.
  - Requires the installation of the CloudWatch agent to stream logs.
  - Supports filters, search expressions, and log groups for log management.
- AWS X-Ray:

![Key concepts and topics Review the content below to reinforce some of the key concepts and topics presented to you in the video above. Mapping to AWS tools CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers. CloudWatch is cloud-native and all the AWS services automatically publish telemetry data to CloudWatch without you needing to do anything. It creates a single solution for both metrics and logs, which is useful when you are troubleshooting issues. CloudWatch enables you to automate monitoring by using SDKs, APIs, command line interfaces, CloudFormation templates, and more. ](../../../media/AWS-DevOps-Module-12-44-image2.png){width="10.083333333333334in" height="6.989583333333333in"}

![AWS x-Ray AWS X-Ray works for both simple and complex applications, either in development or in production. You can analyze simple asynchronous event calls, three-tier web applications, or complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services. With X-Ray, you can trace requests made to applications that span multiple AWS accounts, AWS Regions, and Availability Zones. AWS X-Ray works with Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), AWS Lambda, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. You can use X-Ray with applications written in Java, Node.js, and .NET that are deployed on these services. AWS X-Ray helps you identify performance bottlenecks. X-Ray's service maps let you see relationships between services and resources in your application in real time. You can easily detect where high latencies are occurring, visualize node and edge latency distribution for services, and then drill down into the specific services and paths impacting application performance. ](../../../media/AWS-DevOps-Module-12-44-image10.png){width="10.083333333333334in" height="5.979166666666667in"}

![Utilizing AWS App Mesh AWS App Mesh is a service mesh that provides application-level networking to make it easy for your services to communicate with each other across multiple types of compute infrastructure. App Mesh standardizes how your services communicate, giving you complete visibility and ensuring high-availability for your applications. Modern applications are typically composed of multiple services. Each service may be built using multiple types of compute infrastructure, such as Amazon EC2 and AWS Fargate. As the number of services grow within an application, it becomes difficult to pinpoint the exact location of errors, reroute traffic after failures, and safely deploy code changes. Previously, this has required you to build monitoring and control logic directly into your code and redeploy your service every time there are changes. ](../../../media/AWS-DevOps-Module-12-44-image13.png){width="10.083333333333334in" height="4.625in"}
