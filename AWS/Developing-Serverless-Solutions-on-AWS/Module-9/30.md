Summary

Observability and monitoring are essential for understanding and ensuring the health of modern applications, with the three pillars of observability being logs, metrics, and tracing.

Facts

- Observability contrasts with traditional monitoring, focusing on visibility into the system's state.
- Traditional monitoring often involved remoting into servers and querying to identify failures.
- Modern applications have shifted from long-lived servers to short-lived resources, necessitating centralized logging.
- Increased data collection, faster release velocities, and user experience monitoring are now more prevalent in modern applications.
- Monitoring focuses on identifying failures by watching stack layers, primarily through metrics.
- Observability emphasizes understanding if an application behaves as expected, looking at customer experiences and trends.
- Logs are generated by applications, services, and operating systems, aiding in diagnosing issues.
- Metrics, produced by services and applications, can be used to set alarms and monitor trends.
- Tracing tracks a request through multiple services using a unique trace ID, helping correlate actions across services.
- Observability helps detect subtle issues, like a drop in successful sign-ins, which might not be flagged by traditional monitoring.
- Monitoring might identify explicit failures, while observability can highlight unexpected behaviors or trends.



![Short-lived resources We loose access to the infrastructure after the execution of business logic is complete. We cannot install background agents for collection of execution data in this scenario. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-9-30-image1.png){width="4.0in" height="2.076388888888889in"}









![More devices, services and data The multiple devices and services connected over the network, collecting batch data from all the devices is a challenge. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-9-30-image2.png){width="3.7916666666666665in" height="1.9375in"}



![Faster release velocity With distributed component development and deployment, the application release cycle is shortened. Defining additional observability mechanisms in this scenario is a challenge. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-9-30-image3.png){width="3.576388888888889in" height="2.6041666666666665in"}



![User experience Irrespective of other challenges, user experience is the more important consideration for the performance of your applications. Latency in the application execution due to monitoring and observability mechanisms is not acceptable. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-9-30-image4.png){width="3.9791666666666665in" height="2.7291666666666665in"}





![Observability in serverless applications Monitoring in traditional applications has evolved into Observability in modern applications. Monitoring focused on identifying failures across the layers of your stack, whereas Observability reflects an approach to organizational culture and development practices that drive how you think about collecting and using data about your system to do more than monitor for failures. Observability extends traditional monitoring with approaches that address the kinds of questions you want to answer about your applications. Business metrics are sometimes an afterthought, only coming into play when someone in the business asks the question, and you need to figure out how to get the answers from the data you have. But if you build these needs into the application, you will have much more visibility into what's happening within your application. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-9-30-image5.png){width="5.0in" height="2.9166666666666665in"}

![Logs Logs are timestamped records of discrete events, such as a failure, error, or state change. Logs may include metrics. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-9-30-image7.png){width="3.9791666666666665in" height="1.9375in"}



![Metrics Metrics provide numeric data measured at intervals. These are often service-level indicators like request rate or error rates but can also be business metrics like the number of orders or payments received. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-9-30-image8.png){width="3.9166666666666665in" height="2.2569444444444446in"}
