## Overview

You deployed your serverless bookmark application, and then updated it to support bookmark sharing, routing of requests to the shared mailbox, and a contest feature. The managers who review the knowledge base submissions recognize that submissions are going to increase a lot with the application, so they want you to scale their submissions process by automating as much of it as possible. As part of their manual review, the managers check to make sure the submission isn't a duplicate, validate the URL and make sure it meets eligibility requirements to be shared, and then publish the resource. Then, the managers let the submitter know whether or not the item was added. When the item is a duplicate or is invalid, the submitter does not get a contest entry for that item, so the managers need to inform the contest administrator of duplicates and bad submissions. Given the variety of sources and type of materials that might be shared, the managers still want to maintain a manual approval step so that they can review the material and make sure it follows practices and technologies that they want to promote.

In this lab, you use AWS Step Functions to incorporate a workflow to automatically evaluate and publish new submissions, while still including a manual approval step as part of the process.

The following architecture diagram shows the components that have been or will be deployed in this lab.

## Task 1: Understanding key services and the environment setup

In this task, you look at the different AWS services that are used in this lab. The services include Step Functions and Amazon SNS.

- **AWS Step Functions** is a serverless function orchestrator that makes it easy to sequence Lambda functions and multiple AWS services into business-critical applications. Through its visual interface, you can create and run a series of checkpointed and event-driven workflows that maintain the application state. The output of one step acts as input to the next. Each step in your application runs in order, as defined by your business logic. Orchestrating a series of individual serverless applications, managing retries, and debugging failures can be challenging. As your distributed applications become more complex, the complexity of managing them also grows. Step Functions automatically manages error handling, retry logic, and state. With its built-in operational controls, Step Functions manages sequencing, error handling, retry logic, and state, removing a significant operational burden from your team.
- **Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)** is a fully managed messaging service for both system-to-system and app-to-person (A2P) communication. The service enables you to communicate between systems through publish/subscribe (pub/sub) patterns that enable messaging between decoupled microservice applications or to communicate directly to users via SMS, mobile push, and email. The system-to-system pub/sub functionality provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan out messages to a large number of subscriber systems or customer endpoints including Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues, Lambda functions, and HTTP/S, for parallel processing. The A2P messaging functionality enables you to send messages to users at scale using either a pub/sub pattern or direct-publish messages using a single API.

In this task, you use the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE) and download the application code. The front-end and backend code combine the workflows and resources from Labs 1 and 2. The code also contains new Lambda functions, a new API Gateway endpoint, and an SNS topic for the manual approval of the bookmark publishing process.

After downloading the code, you launch and deploy the application via the Amplify console.

1.  At the top of the AWS Management Console, to the right of the Services menu, in the search bar, search for

Cloud9

and then choose that service from the list.

2.  Next to the **BookmarkAppDevEnv** environment listing, choose **Open** .

Within a few seconds, the AWS Cloud9 environment launches.

**Note** If the browser is running in an incognito session, a pop-up window with an error message will be displayed when the Cloud9 instance is opened. Choose the **OK** button to continue. Browser in a non incognito mode is recommended.

1.  In the terminal pane, run the following commands to download the application code and run the startup script:

wget <https://us-west-2-tcprod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses/ILT-TF-200-SVDVSS/v1.3.4.prod-0a2cd90d/lab-3-Step-Functions/scripts/app-code.zip>
unzip app-code.zip
cd app-code
chmod +x resize.sh
chmod +x startupscript.sh
./startupscript.sh

The script takes a couple of minutes to run. When it is finished, you will deploy your bookmark application through Amplify.

### What is the script doing?

- This script modifies the **samconfig.toml** file within the backend portion of the application code.
- The script replaces values such as AWS Region, stack name, and role Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
- The script then updates the **aws-exports.js file** with the Amazon Cognito metadata that was launched in the lab AWS CloudFormation template.
- As part of the AWS SAM deployment, a new API Gateway resource and a few Lambda functions are deployed. These functions are needed for the Step Functions workflow.
- The script then runs **npm build**, deploys the bookmark application, and uploads the **app.zip** file to the **samserverless** bucket.

### Review the resources that have been deployed

1.  Return to the AWS Management Console tab.
2.  At the top of the AWS Management Console, to the right of the Services menu, in the search bar, search for

1.  Choose Create function
2.  Delete the existing code and paste the following code:

import { DynamoDBClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
import { DynamoDBDocumentClient, QueryCommand, UpdateCommand } from "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb";

const dynamodb = new DynamoDBClient({});
const docClient = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(dynamodb);


export const handler = async message => {
console.log(message);
let bookmark = message;
const bookmarkDetails = JSON.stringify(bookmark);
console.log("bookmarkDetails are "+bookmarkDetails);
const bookmarkItem = JSON.parse(bookmarkDetails);
console.log("bookmarkItem "+bookmarkItem);
console.log("url is "+bookmarkItem.detail.payload.bookmarkUrl.S);
var exists = false;
try{
if(message != null)
{
var params = {
TableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME,
IndexName: process.env.INDEX_NAME,
KeyConditionExpression: "bookmarkUrl = :keyurl",
ExpressionAttributeValues: {
":keyurl": bookmarkItem.detail.payload.bookmarkUrl.S
}
};
console.log("exists "+exists);
console.log(params);
var result = await docClient.send(new QueryCommand(params))
console.log("result is "+JSON.stringify(result.Items));
var data = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(result.Items));

data.forEach(function(item) {
console.log("db username", item.username+" "+bookmarkItem.detail.payload.username.S);
if (item.username != bookmarkItem.detail.payload.username.S)
exists = true;
});

console.log(exists);
if (exists === true)
{
console.log("in here");
var updateParams = {
TableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME,
Key:{
"id": bookmarkItem.detail.payload.id.S
},
UpdateExpression: "set contest=:c",
ExpressionAttributeValues:{
":c": "duplicate"
},
ReturnValues:"UPDATED_NEW"
};
await docClient.send(new UpdateCommand(updateParams), function(err, data) {
if (err) {
console.log("Unable to update item. Error JSON:", JSON.stringify(err, null, 2));
}
else {
console.log("UpdateItem succeeded:", JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
}
});
return "Duplicate";
}
}
}

catch(e){
console.log(e);
}
return "NotDuplicate";
};

**Note** This Lambda function is the first function that runs as part of the Step Functions state machine. The function checks whether a new bookmark URL is a duplicate.

1.  In the breadcrumbs at the top left of the page, choose **Functions**.

Review the following functions, which are used in the Step Functions workflow:

- **validateURL:** This function validates if the user entered a valid URL.
- **userApprovalEmail:** This function generates a URL for human approval or rejection and notifies the **ContestTopic**.
- **userApproval:** This function gets the approve or reject value after the user chooses the URL generated from the **userApprovalEmail** function.
- **publishApproval:** If the URL is approved, this function updates the DynamoDB table with the approved value.

**Note** To see all of these functions, you may need to go to the second page of the functions list.

## Task 4: Setting up the state machine workflow invoked by the EventBridge rule

In this task, you set up a Step Functions state machine and an EventBridge rule. The EventBridge rule will invoke the state machine that you create.

## Task 5: Reviewing the deployment and running test cases using the application

In this task, you take a quick overview of all of the components that have been deployed so far. You then run a few test cases to test the Step Functions workflow and the EventBridge rule. Note the following:

- The backend and front end have been integrated for end-to-end testing.
- You created a Lambda function and a state machine manually.
- You reviewed the Lambda functions that the AWS SAM deploy process created for the Step Functions state machine workflow.
- You updated the state machine with the Lambda function ARNs, API Gateway endpoint, and SNS topic ARN.



1.  Open and log in to the bookmark application, if you are not already logged in.

### Test case 1: Add a new bookmark without the shared flag

In this test case, add a new *unshared* bookmark. Check the Step Functions state machine to see if it was invoked or not. Then, share the new bookmark and approve it.

1.  In the bookmark application, add a new bookmark with the **Share Bookmark** toggle set to **Off**. Make sure you enter a valid bookmark URL.
2.  At the top of the AWS Management Console, to the right of the Services menu, in the search bar, search for

Step Functions

and then choose that service from the list.

3.  Choose the name of the **PublishStateMachine** state machine.

No jobs are listed in the **Running** state because the unshared bookmark did not invoke the **PublishStateMachine** workflow.

### Test case 2: Add a new bookmark with the shared flag

In this test case, add a new *shared* bookmark. Then, approve the new bookmark.

1.  In the bookmark application, add a new bookmark with the **Share Bookmark** toggle set to **On**. Make sure you enter a valid bookmark URL.

This invokes the **PublishStateMachine** workflow.

1.  Return to the browser tab featuring the **AWS Management Console** with the **Step Functions** open.
2.  Refresh the screen to update the status of the **PublishStateMachine** state machine.
3.  Choose the name of the **Running** state.

Scroll down to the **Graph view** section, and review the state machine steps.

Because this is a new bookmark and no duplicates are found, the **duplicateBookmarkCheck** function sends a **NotDuplicate** message and invokes the **validateURL** function.

Because this is a valid URL, the **validateURL** function sends a **Valid** message and invokes the **userApprovalEmail** function.

1.  Check your email for approve and reject links from the **userApprovalEmail** function.
2.  Choose the approval URL, and check the Step Functions workflow.

Because you manually approved the URL, the **publishApproval** function is invoked, and the contest value in the DynamoDB table is updated to **Approved**.

### Test case 3: Add a bookmark with an invalid URL

In this test case, add a new *shared* bookmark that is *invalid*. Then, share the new bookmark.

1.  In the bookmark application, add a new bookmark URL **without** any of the generic top level domains (".edu" or ".gov" or ".com" or ".info" or ".mil" or ".net" or ".org") such as

aws.training

in the URL field. Make sure the **Share Bookmark** toggle is set to **On**.

This invokes the **PublishStateMachine** workflow.

1.  Return to the browser tab featuring the **AWS Management Console** with the **Step Functions** open.
2.  Choose the name of the **PublishStateMachine** state machine from the breadcrumbs trail near the top.
3.  Choose the name of the second state.

Scroll down to the **Graph view** section, and review the state machine steps.

Because this is a new bookmark and no duplicates are found, the **duplicateBookmarkCheck** function sends a **NotDuplicate** message and invokes the **validateURL** function.

Because this is *not* a valid URL, the **validateURL** function sends an **Invalid** message and invokes the **notifyUser** function.

### Test case 4: Add a duplicate bookmark as a different user

In this test case, add a *new* user account in the bookmark application. Then, add a *shared* bookmark that is a duplicate of a bookmark (URL) that another user added.

1.  In the bookmark application, create a second user account.
2.  Add a bookmark that is a duplicate of a bookmark that another user added. Make sure the **Share Bookmark** toggle is set to **On**.

**Note** Only the URL field value is checked for duplicate.

This invokes the **PublishStateMachine** workflow.

1.  Return to the browser tab featuring the **AWS Management Console** with the **Step Functions** open.
2.  Choose the name of the **PublishStateMachine** state machine.
3.  Choose the name of the most recently started state.

Scroll down to the **Graph view** section, and review the state machine steps.

Because this is a duplicate bookmark that was already shared, the **duplicateBookmarkCheck** function sends a **Duplicate** message and invokes the **notifyUser** function to send an email saying the bookmark is a duplicate.

**Note** If you have lab time remaining, run a few test cases for the human rejection process.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have successfully:

- Configured EventBridge to target a Step Functions workflow
- Used a Step Functions Standard workflow to orchestrate tasks
- Used Lambda for tasks within a Step Functions state machine
