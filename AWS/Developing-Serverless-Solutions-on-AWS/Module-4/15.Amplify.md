Summary

The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of tools and services designed to expedite the deployment of mobile and web apps, offering pre-built libraries and UI components, a CLI for creating applications, and an Amplify Console for a centralized view of CI/CD pipelines, all aimed at facilitating rapid and best-practice-driven development.

Facts

- Amplify Framework consists of Amplify Libraries, Amplify CLI, and the Amplify Console, each serving distinct purposes in app development.
- Amplify Libraries provide use case-centric client libraries that integrate into code, aiding in faster development by offering pre-built solutions and following best practices.
- Amplify Framework supports the creation of solutions with pre-built UI components, assisting with common front-end development use cases and frameworks.
- Amplify CLI offers a guided, opinionated approach for creating applications on AWS, building out solutions based on answers to a series of questions, ensuring adherence to best practices.
- Amplify Console provides a centralized view of CI/CD pipelines for Amplify applications, allowing for efficient management and monitoring.
- Amplify CLI includes commands like amplify add auth and amplify add api to integrate authentication and APIs directly into applications, respectively, streamlining the development process.
- Amplify supports local testing of applications through commands like amplify mock api, allowing developers to verify their applications before deployment.
- Amplify Documentation provides detailed insights into various components like Amplify Libraries, Amplify Studio, the CLI, and Hosting, aiding developers in understanding and utilizing the service effectively.
- Amplify facilitates the creation of backends visually, allowing developers to drag and drop configurations directly in the browser and pull them locally for further work.
- Amplify, along with AWS SAM and the CDK, transforms into CloudFormation templates, maintaining CloudFormation as the underlying technology.
- Amplify is particularly beneficial for front-end applications, mobile applications, and front-end clients, offering seamless integration with AppSync and GraphQL APIs.
- The framework is designed to be user-friendly, allowing developers to leverage AWS services like Cognito for authorization without requiring deep knowledge of the service.
- Amplify, AWS SAM, and the CDK are all frameworks that help in building applications faster and more reliably, each with its unique approach and focus, but ultimately converting to CloudFormation templates for deployment.

![AWS Amplify consists of a set of tools (open source framework, visual development environment, console) and services (web app and static website hosting) to accelerate the development of mobile and web applications on AWS. Amplify's open source framework includes an opinionated set of libraries, UI components, and a command line interface (CLI) to build an app backend and integrate it with your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native apps. The framework leverages a core set of AWS Cloud Services to offer capabilities including offline data, authentication, analytics, push notifications, and bots at high scale. Amplify Studio further simplifies the configuration of backends and frontend UIs with a visual point-and-click experience that works seamlessly with the Amplify CLI. Amplify Studio also includes functionality for managing app content and users. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-4-15.Amplify-image2.png){width="10.083333333333334in" height="5.614583333333333in"}![Amplify components To learn more, expand each of the following four components of the open-source mobile and web app development framework. Amplify Libraries The Amplify open-source client libraries provide use-case centric, opinionated, declarative, and easy-to-use interfaces across different categories of cloud powered operations enabling mobile and web developers to easily interact with their backends. These libraries are powered by the AWS cloud and offer a pluggable model which can be extended to use other providers. The libraries can be used with both new backends created using the Amplify CLI and existing backend resources. Amplify Studio AWS Amplify Studio is a visual development environment for building fullstack web and mobile apps. Studio builds on existing backend building capabilities in AWS Amplify, allowing you to accelerate your UI development as well. With Studio, you can quickly build an entire web app, front-to-back, with minimal coding, while still maintaining full control over your app design and behavior through code. Ship faster, scale effortlessly, and delight every user. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-4-15.Amplify-image3.png){width="10.083333333333334in" height="8.5in"}![Amplify CLI The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified toolchain to create, integrate, and manage the AWS cloud services for your app. Amplify hosting Amplify Hosting provides a git-based workflow for hosting full-stack serverless web apps with continuous deployment.
