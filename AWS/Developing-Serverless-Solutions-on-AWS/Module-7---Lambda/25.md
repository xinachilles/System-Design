Summary

The text delves into best practices for managing versions and aliases of AWS Lambda functions, emphasizing the utility of versions for rollbacks, the flexibility of aliases, and the potential for gradual deployments using routing configurations.

Facts

- Lambda functions can be versioned, capturing the function configuration, code, and events.
- The $LATEST reference points to the most recent version of a Lambda function.
- Lambda function ARNs can specify either $LATEST or a specific version.
- Versions can be useful for rollbacks without redeploying the function.
- Aliases act as pointers to specific versions or $LATEST.
- Aliases can be referenced in ARNs, offering flexibility in directing traffic to specific versions.
- Aliases support routing configurations, allowing for distribution of requests between different versions.
- Routing configurations can be used for gradual deployments, adjusting traffic distribution based on confidence in the new version's stability.







![Versions You can use versions to manage the deployment of your functions. $LATEST represents the latest version of the lambda function.

![Aliases You can create one or more aliases for your Lambda function. A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific function version. To learn more, choose each hotspot: arn : aws : 1 ambda : aws- regi on : acct-i d : functi on : hel 1 oworl d : TEST $ LATEST version Alias: 0 90 % CAI i as : 10% 1 version 2 DEV TEST Now that you know, how to use versions and aliases of lambda functions. In the following lesson, you will learn, best practices while running and testing a lambda function. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-7---Lambda-25-image3.png){width="5.0in" height="4.333333333333333in"}



![Alias to $LATEST version You can create an alias and associate it to any version of your function, including $LATEST. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-7---Lambda-25-image4.png){width="3.9166666666666665in" height="1.625in"}





![Aliases for different purposes A common use of aliases might be to have DEV and TEST aliases. When version 2 has been unit tested and is ready for broader testing, you can point the TEST alias at version 2 instead of version 1 . ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-7---Lambda-25-image5.png){width="3.9166666666666665in" height="2.4791666666666665in"}



![Weighted Aliases With Lambda, you can also use alias routing to have an alias point to two versions, sending a percentage of traffic to each version. So, for example, when you first start using version 2 as your test version, you might only send a small portion of traffic to make sure there are no unexpected integration issues. Then, you could update the configuration to send 100% of traffic to version 2 when you are confident it is working as expected. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-7---Lambda-25-image6.png){width="3.6041666666666665in" height="4.0625in"}
