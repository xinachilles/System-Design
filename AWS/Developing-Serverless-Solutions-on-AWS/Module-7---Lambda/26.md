Summary

The text highlights various methods for running, testing, and debugging AWS Lambda functions, emphasizing the benefits of local testing with SAM CLI to expedite the development cycle.

Facts

- Within the AWS console, users can configure test events for Lambda functions and view outputs directly.
- Logging statements from Lambda functions can be viewed in CloudWatch Logs.
- Lambda blueprints provide sample events, aiding in understanding event structures.
- SAM CLI allows for local invocation and testing of Lambda functions.
- Local testing with SAM CLI shortens the code-test-debug cycle.
- SAM CLI can simulate the Lambda execution environment using Docker containers.
- Debugging locally with SAM CLI allows for step-through debugging in an IDE.
- SAM can also simulate an API Gateway locally, enabling testing with actual HTTP requests without deploying to AWS.

Testing from the console From the Lambda console you can: Configure multiple test events • View results on the console or in CloudWatch Try it To test a function in your own account, choose a function, and choose configure test events from the dropdown next to the Test button. Name the test event, and add a test event payload. Lambda blueprints include configured test events that you can use. Choose Create to save the test event. Choose Test. Your results display in a panel above the main console sections. Using AWS SAM CLI for testing Using the AWS SAM CLI to invoke and test your function from the command line: • Testing and debugging serverless applications Examples • Generate sample payloads • Step-through debugging Lambda functions locally ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-7---Lambda-26-image1.png)
