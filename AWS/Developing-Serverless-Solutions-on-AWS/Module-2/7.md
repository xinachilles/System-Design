Summary

- GraphQL and AWS AppSync offer a more efficient way to retrieve data compared to traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to request multiple data types in a single query.
- GraphQL uses a predefined schema to specify the data that can be requested and the operations that can be performed.
- Resolvers in GraphQL determine where the requested data is sourced from.
- GraphQL provides a more strongly typed schema compared to API Gateway.
- GraphQL uses HTTP POST for queries, while API Gateway uses HTTP methods for resource routes.
- GraphQL allows for multiple authorization options on the same API, whereas API Gateway supports only one per resource.
- API Gateway can invoke Lambda functions synchronously and requires manual retry handling.
- API Gateway supports REST APIs, including HTTP APIs and WebSocket APIs, and can proxy requests to AWS services.
- GraphQL APIs are a newer technology that can consolidate multiple requests into one, making them suitable for specific use cases.

Facts

- GraphQL and AWS AppSync provide a more efficient alternative to REST APIs by allowing clients to request diverse data types in a single query.
- GraphQL uses predefined schemas to specify allowable data requests and operations.
- Resolvers in GraphQL locate and facilitate communication with the data sources.
- GraphQL enforces a strongly typed schema, unlike API Gateway.
- GraphQL uses HTTP POST for queries, whereas API Gateway relies on HTTP methods for routing.
- GraphQL offers multiple authorization options on a single API, whereas API Gateway supports only one per resource.
- API Gateway can invoke Lambda functions synchronously and requires manual retry implementation.
- API Gateway supports various REST APIs, including HTTP APIs and WebSocket APIs, and can proxy requests to AWS services.
- GraphQL APIs are newer and can consolidate multiple requests into one, making them suitable for specific use cases.

![The GraphQL schema defines the shape of the data that flows through your API, and it also defines the operations that can be performed. GraphQL resolvers connect the fields in a type's schema to a data source. Resolvers are the mechanism by which requests are fulfilled. Data sources are resources in your AWS account that GraphQL APIs can interact with. You can configure an AWS AppSync API to interact with multiple data sources. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-2-7-image4.png)

![1 w Am rights reservcyd. AWS AppSync AWS AppSync can automatically create and connect resolvers from a schema, or create a schema and connect resolvers from an existing table. An AWS AppSync API can be configured to interact with multiple data sources, which means that you can aggregate data in a single location. AWS AppSync can use AWS resources from your account that already exist, or it can provision Amazon DynamoDB tables on your behalf from a schema definition. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-2-7-image6.png)



![GraphQL schema The GraphQL schema defines the data and the operations that can be performed. There are three top-level operations: 1. Query: Read-only fetch 2.

![REST API With a REST API, you might need to make multiple sequential calls to get the data that you need. In this example, you have a travel site, where users can select destinations and get details about the destination to help them make decisions about where to go. Typically with REST, each distinct type of information to be returned is handled by its own resource that you need to call. To fulfill this request, you need three different calls: the first to retrieve details about the selected destination, the second to get the weather for the destination, and the third to get the list of things to do associated with that destination. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-2-7-image11.png)



![GraphQL with AWS AppSync With GraphQL, the schema for getAllDestinations includes fields for destinations, activities, weather, and hotels. You can make a single call and request only the fields you want (in this example, activities and weather for the specific destination, North Carolina). Resolvers connect to the different data sources that provide that information, and AWS AppSync provides the combined results to the client. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-2-7-image12.png)
