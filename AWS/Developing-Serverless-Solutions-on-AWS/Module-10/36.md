Summary

Lambda offers robust application security features, including controlled access, VPC configurations, data protection, and mechanisms to prevent unauthorized code changes and SQL injections.

Facts

- Lambda functions can access other AWS resources using the AWS SDK.
- The principle of least privilege is recommended when creating execution roles for Lambda.
  - For instance, specific DynamoDB actions should be allowed for specific functions rather than granting blanket permissions.



![Limiting the scope of Lambda function permissions Lambda function permissions should be as granular as possible. Similarly, limit the scope of what the function can do via its execution role. The get function should have only read permissions for the Bookmarks table that houses the bookmark data, whereas the store function has permissions to write to it. Each function should be given just enough permissions to do its task. If you find yourself needing to give broad permissions to a function, consider splitting it up. The stream function has specific permissions for reading records off of the Amazon DynamoDB stream for the Bookmarks table.

![Use granular invoke permissions The invoke permissions for the get and store Lambda functions are scoped by the way the API is defined and integrated with Lambda. Each method has permissions to invoke just the function associated with that method, and the Lambda contest function can be invoked only by the Amazon EventBridge rule associated with it. The resource-based policy associated with each Lambda function controls these permissions. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-10-36-image3.png){width="4.020833333333333in" height="4.09375in"}

- By default, Lambda functions cannot access resources within a VPC; a connection setup is required.
  - Lambda uses elastic network interfaces (ENI) in VPC subnets to access resources.
  - VPC interface endpoints can be created to route traffic between Lambda and VPC resources.



![SECURITY WHILE ACCESSING SECURITY WHILE ACCESSING vpc RESOURCES FROM LAMBDA FROM YOUR vpc LAMBDA ENSURE TO DEPLOY OF LAMBDA WITH A vpc CONFIGURATION When your function is invoked, Lambda runs your function code securely within an AWS owned VPC. To enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC, you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information that includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs. Lambda uses this information to set up elastic network interfaces, which enable your function to connect securely to other resources within your private VPC. Lambda function execution role must have permissions to create, describe, and delete elastic network interfaces. Lambda provides a permissions policy, named AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole, that has the necessary permissions. AWS reuses the elastic network interfaces that it creates to route multiple instances of your function to the VPC resources. Once you enable your function to access VPC, all traffic is subject to the routing rules of your VPC, which means that you can target only private subnets and have no direct outbound routes. If your function needs public internet access, you need a route to the public internet via a NAT gateway. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-10-36-image5.png){width="5.0in" height="3.1666666666666665in"}

- Condition keys in IAM policies can enforce Lambda functions to be deployed with specific VPC configurations.
- Lambda functions can use environment variables, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, or AWS Secrets Manager to store and retrieve key-value pairs.
  - Secrets Manager can automatically rotate secrets based on a schedule.





- ![Protect database credentials Use Secrets Manager to protect database credentials. Secrets Manager takes care of the following: Storing the credentials securely. • Giving you SDK methods to retrieve them. Letting you rotate these credentials without disrupting applications for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Redshift, and DocumentDB. This makes it much easier to use temporary credentials versus long-term ones that are less secure. Allowing you to secure access to the credentials with IAM.

- 
- SQL injections can be prevented by using parameterized queries or escaping data inputs.
- Lambda Code Signing ensures that the deployment package hasn't been tampered with.
  - It allows admins to set signature validation policies to warn, allow, or deny uploads based on their signatures.

![Protecting data that you pass to Lambda functions When it comes to passing data to Lambda functions, you have three options: Environment variables Values in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Values in AWS Secrets Manager All three can use either AWS managed or customer managed keys to protect sensitive information. Environment Variables can use AV.'S managed or customer keys Shared across rnultiple applications/ functions Secrets rotation and Throughput vs. cost AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Secrets Man aar AWS Secrets Manager and throughput to Patar,eter Store • Environment variables are scoped to a single function. Values in Parameter Store or Secrets Manager can be shared across multiple applications. Secrets Manager has the added benefit of secrets rotation and cross- account access. • Parameter Store has a lower cost than Secrets Manager, but Secrets Manager provides better throughput than Parameter Store. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-10-36-image11.png){width="5.0in" height="3.2916666666666665in"}



![Protecting your functions from attack There are four measures, you might consider while protecting your Lambda functions against any attacks: Reduce dependency vulnerabilities Protect against SQL injections Use Lambda code signing Protect database credentials. To learn more about each of the security measures, expand each of the four categories. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-10-36-image12.png){width="5.0in" height="2.6041666666666665in"}



![Reduce dependency vulnerabilities Control the dependencies in your function's deployment package. The AWS Lambda execution environment contains a number of libraries such as the AWS SDK for the Node.js and Python runtimes . To enable the latest set of features and security updates, Lambda will periodically update these libraries. These updates may introduce subtle changes to the behavior of your Lambda function. To have full control of the dependencies your function uses, package all of your dependencies with your deployment package and reduce the dependency vulnerabilities. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-10-36-image13.png){width="5.0in" height="2.0in"}



![Protect against SQL injection attacks Lambda functions are initiated by events. These events submit an event parameter to the Lambda function. In this example, a SQL injection on the "fname" string is passed into your Lambda function handler. If you trust user input on the Lambda function and run this Java snippet, your results are not protected. You can prevent this type of attack by parameterizing queries so that your Lambda function ". OR '1'='1" expects a single input. 2 3 5 "all": "insert": "0" n public Stri ng handleRequest(Event input, Context context) { connection connection = getRemoteconnecti on ( ) ; --- connection. createstatement() ; statement stmt --- ""SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE fname-' " String query = + input. getFname() + Resultset rs = stmt. executeQuery(query) ; ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-10-36-image14.png){width="5.0in" height="4.385416666666667in"}



![Use Lambda code signing Lambda code signing lets you set a profile that is used to determine how functions within that organization must be signed when uploaded to Lambda. Admins can create the resource code- signing configuration. Each code-signing configuration profile has a signature validation policy that either warns but allows an upload that isn't signed or denies uploads of code that isn't signed with the correct signature. • Create a policy that warns or denies deployment of Lambda functions that fail the signing profile. Sign (AWS-SHA384-ECDSA) a deployment package to make sure that code has not been altered. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-10-36-image15.png){width="5.0in" height="2.6458333333333335in"}
