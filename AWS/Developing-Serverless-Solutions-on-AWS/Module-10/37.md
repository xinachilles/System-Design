Summary

Serverless data stores, such as S3 and DynamoDB, offer multiple layers of security and encryption options to ensure data protection.

Facts

- S3 buckets and objects are private by default.
- S3's "Block public access" feature prevents accidental public exposure of objects.
- Bucket policies, which are resource-based, can define permissions for individual S3 buckets.

- Origin access control from CloudFront can restrict access to S3, ensuring only CloudFront interacts with it.
- Both IAM policies and bucket policies are recommended for granting access to S3 buckets. IAM policies and bucket policies same



- DynamoDB encrypts data at rest using keys from AWS KMS (Key Management Service).
  - Users can choose between AWS service keys or customer-managed keys.
- S3 supports three server-side encryption options:
  - SSE-S3: Uses Amazon S3 managed keys.
  - SSE-KMS: Uses AWS KMS keys, providing an audit trail and more control.
  - SSE-C: Allows users to provide their own encryption key.
- S3 can be configured to automatically encrypt objects before storage, and this is now the default behavior.



![Protecting data in Amazon S3 Amazon S3 resources---buckets, objects, and related sub-resources---are private: only the resource owner (the AWS account that created it) can access the resource. Amazon S3 supports two types of access policies: identity-based (user) and resource-based (bucket) policies. With identity-based access, permissions are associated with an identity, and those who have the identity can perform the actions in the policy. With resource-based access, the permissions are associated with the bucket or objects in the bucket. For example, you might deny permissions to perform operations on a specified bucket unless the request originates from within a range of IP addresses. An access control list (ACL) is another example of a resource-based policy.

![Protecting data at rest in DynamoDB and Amazon S3 In terms of protecting data at rest, AWS data stores provide encryption at rest via configuration options that you control. Encryption options take advantage of AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and keys that you or AWS manage.

![All data stored in DynamoDB is fully encrypted at rest using encryption keys stored in AWS KMS. You choose whether to use AWS service keys or customer managed keys when you create a table. Amazon S3 supports server-side encryption using one of three options: 1 . Amazon S3 managed keys 2. AWS KMS keys stored in AWS KMS 3. Customer provided keys You can configure your Amazon S3 buckets to automatically encrypt objects before storing them if the incoming storage requests do not have any encryption information. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-10-37-image4.png){width="5.0in" height="2.6666666666666665in"}
