Summary

The text delves into the importance of implementing comprehensive security measures at various layers of AWS services, emphasizing the shared responsibility model between AWS and its customers, with special focus on serverless services.

Facts

- Security needs to be applied at various layers such as network edges, compute services, and APIs.
- AWS follows the "shared responsibility model" where AWS is responsible for "security of the cloud" while customers are responsible for "security in the cloud."
- AWS manages security aspects like global infrastructure and foundation services.
- Customers must address security concerns such as patching operating systems, configuring networks, enabling encryption, and establishing correct firewall settings.
- Customers are solely responsible for their data within AWS, ensuring protective controls like identity, access controls, and data encryption.
- Serverless services change the responsibility dynamics; AWS handles more aspects, leaving customers mainly responsible for access control and client-side data encryption.
- Specific AWS services to aid in security include API Gateway, Lambda, and Kinesis.
- "Defense in depth" is a strategy encompassing identity and access controls using tools like Amazon Cognito, data protection using CloudFront's field level encryption, and services like Lambda and DynamoDB.
- AWS Shield and WAF (Web Application Firewall) are tools for attack protection against threats like DDoS.
- AWS X-Ray, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Config are services provided for auditing and traceability.

![Applying security at all layers A key principle is that your security strategy should address security at all layers. Use a defense in depth approach that includes multiple security controls. Apply these security design principles at network boundaries, at your application's front door, between its components, and within your code.
