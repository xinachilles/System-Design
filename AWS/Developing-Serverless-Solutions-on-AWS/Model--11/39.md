Summary

Handling scale in serverless applications involves understanding and controlling the scaling mechanisms of services like API Gateway and Lambda, continually evaluating scaling decisions, and ensuring the system can handle anticipated demands through practices like load testing.

Facts

- Managed services like API Gateway scale automatically, but controlling the pace of scaling is crucial.
- Lambda offers features like reserved concurrency and provisioned concurrency to manage scaling during high event influxes.
- Different event sources, such as SQS and Kinesis, have unique scaling behaviors when integrated with Lambda.
- Continual evaluation of scaling decisions is essential due to the evolving nature of the AWS ecosystem.
- Understanding quotas for services like Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, and Kinesis is vital.
- The interactions between different AWS services can impact each other's scaling mechanisms.
- Trade-offs and optimizations, such as adding more shards to Kinesis or using parallelization factors, need consideration.
- Load testing that mimics production patterns helps in anticipating and preparing for real-world demands.
- Monitoring patterns in production allows for dynamic scaling adjustments.
- Avoiding scenarios where unexpected demand overwhelms the system is crucial for maintaining service availability.





![Thinking serverless at scale means knowing the quotas of the services you are using and focusing on scaling trade-offs and optimizations among those services to find the balance that makes the most sense for your workload. As your solutions evolve and your usage patterns become clearer, you should continue to find ways to optimize performance and costs and make the trade-offs that best support the workload you need rather than trying to scale infinitely on all components. Don't expect to get it perfect on the first deployment. Build in the kind of monitoring and observability that will help you understand what's happening, and be prepared to tweak things that make sense for the access patterns that happen in production. In the following lesson, you learn how to use API Gateway to manage scale. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Model--11-39-image1.png)
