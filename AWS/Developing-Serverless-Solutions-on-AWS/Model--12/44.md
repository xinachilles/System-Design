Summary

Best practices for CI/CD pipelines in serverless deployments emphasize continuous testing, environment isolation, and efficient secret management. Utilizing tools like AWS SAM and AWS CDK can streamline deployment processes, ensuring safer and more consistent deployments across different environments.

Facts

- Continuous testing throughout the deployment pipeline is essential.
- Code reviews via pull requests help ensure code quality before merging.
- Linting, syntax checks, and unit tests should be run on the build server.
- Mocked or stubbed-out integration tests are useful in a deploy testing environment.
- Real service tests should be conducted in a deploy-staging environment.
- Canary deployments allow for gradual traffic shifting to new application versions.
- SAM templates with AutoPublishAlias can facilitate safe deployments with rollback capabilities.

![Use traffic shifting with pre- and post-deployment hooks • PreTraffc: When the application is deployed, the PreTraffic Lambda function runs to determine if things should continue. If that function completes successfully (i.e., returns a 200 status code), the deployment continues. If the function does not complete successfully, the deployment rolls back. • PostTraffic: If the traffic successfully completes the traffic shifting progression to 100 percent of traffic to the new alias, the PostTraffic Lambda function runs. If it returns a 200 status code, the deployment is complete. If the PostTraffic function is not successful, the deployment is rolled back. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Model--12-44-image2.png){width="5.0in" height="2.46875in"}



- Isolating environments across separate accounts (e.g., dev, staging, production) reduces the risk of accidental modifications.
- Using a single SAM template with parameters across environments ensures consistency.
- Secrets should be managed using Parameter Store, which supports encrypted values and is account-specific.
- AWS SAM and AWS CDK simplify stack and pipeline creation.
- Deployment hooks and traffic shifting enhance deployment safety.
- AWS SAM templates with parameters allow for consistent deployments across different environments.

![Use a separate account per environment It's a best practice with serverless to use separate accounts for each stage or environment in your deployment. Each developer has an account, and the staging and deployment environments are each in their own accounts. This approach limits the blast radius of issues that occur (for example, unexpectedly high concurrency) and allows you to secure each account with IAM credentials more effectively with less complexity in your IAM policies within a given account. It also makes it less complex to differentiate which resources are associated with each environment. Because of the way costs are calculated with serverless, spinning up additional environments doesn't add much to your cost. Other than where you are provisioning concurrency or database capacity, the cost of running tests in three environments is not different than running them in one environment because it's mostly about the total number of transactions that occur, not about having three sets of infrastructure. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Model--12-44-image4.png){width="5.0in" height="3.1979166666666665in"}







![Use one AWS SAM template with parameters across environments As noted earlier, AWS SAM supports CloudFormation syntax so that your AWS SAM template can be the same for each deployment environment with dynamic data for the environment provided when the stack is created or updated. This helps you ensure that you have parity between all testing environments and aren't surprised by configurations or resources that are different or missing from one environment to the next. AWS SAM lets you build out multiple environments using the same template, even across accounts: Use parameters and mappings when possible to build dynamic templates based on user inputs and pseudo parameters, such as AWS: Region • Use the Globals section to simplify templates Use ExportValue and ImportValue to share resource information across stacks ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Model--12-44-image5.png){width="5.0in" height="3.1770833333333335in"}
