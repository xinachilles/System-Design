Summary

This module delves into event-driven development using queues and streams, focusing on the integration of Lambda with event source mappings, the distinction between SQS (Simple Queue Service) and Kinesis Data Streams, and the nuances of handling messages in both systems.

Facts

- Lambda can be integrated with event source mappings, transitioning from direct invocation to a model where Lambda polls event sources for messages.
- Lambda manages SQS queues as an event source, handling scaling, concurrency, reading, and deleting messages.
- SQS is Amazon's managed queuing service, acting as a buffer for messages to decouple application components.
- In SQS, one consumer processes a message once, while in Kinesis Data Streams, multiple consumers can process the same data due to its streaming nature.
- Lambda's interaction with queues and streams involves polling for messages, retrieving batches of records, and processing them.
- If a Lambda function fails to process messages, it retries until the batch succeeds or expires.
- Queues derive value from processing individual messages, with consumers processing and then deleting them.
- Streams, on the other hand, aggregate messages for actionable data and are often used for analytics, with messages remaining available for multiple consumers.
- In queues, failed messages become visible again after the visibility timeout expires.
- In streams, failed messages can block further processing, requiring strategies like batch splitting to address bad messages.
- Streams are designed for continuous and high-volume data, while queues can handle variable message rates.
- Bad messages in queues can be retried and eventually sent to a dead letter queue, while in streams, they can halt progress and need to be addressed to unblock the stream.







![Event source mapping or polling An event source mapping is a Lambda resource that reads from an event source and invokes a Lambda function. You can use event source mappings to process items from a stream or queue in services that don't invoke Lambda functions directly. Queues and streams are two types of polling event sources that can be used to buffer incoming Lambda requests and support asynchronous processing. When you configure a queue or stream as an event source of Lambda, Lambda handles polling the event source for you. Stream or queue Amaze n SQ S Kinesis Streams Batch Of records AWS Lambda Default: Keeo trying the Batch of records Lam b da function Lambda invokes the function synchronously with the batch of records it retrieved from the queue or stream. Lambda invokes your function synchronously with a batch of records it pulled off the queue or stream. With both queues and streams, Lambda has built-in retry behaviors that you have some ability to configure. By default, Lambda will keep retrying a batch of records until the batch succeeds or the records expires. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-6-19-image1.png){width="5.0in" height="3.0520833333333335in"}







![Batching behavior of Lambda Event source mappings read items from a target event source. By default, an event source mapping batches records together into a single payload that Lambda sends to your function. To fine-tune batching behavior, you can configure a batching window and a batch size . A batching window is the maximum amount of time to gather records into a single payload. A batch size is the maximum number of records in a single batch. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-6-19-image2.png){width="5.0in" height="2.3020833333333335in"}



![Queues vs Streams Queues and streams are suited to different types of data patterns, and each processes the data differently. To learn more, choose the appropriate tab. QUEUES STREAMS An individual message is the core entity where you apply some processing or compute. It could be a financial transaction or a command to control an Internet of Things (IOT) device. • The occurrence of messages typically varies. Messages must be deleted off the queue once they have been processed. The queue's retry policy controls how many retries a record will get, and you can connect a dead-letter queue to the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for records that exceed the max receive count you set.

![• A stream of messages is the core entity. Only by looking at many messages together do you get the value of each individual message. The stream of messages is also constant in most cases. Clickstream data from mobile apps, application logs, and home security camera feeds are common examples where streams provide the responsiveness you need to make data actionable.
