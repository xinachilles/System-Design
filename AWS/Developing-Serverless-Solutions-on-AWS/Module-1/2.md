The module discusses the transition from traditional monolithic architectures to serverless architectures by using the analogy of a food truck (monolith) versus a sit-down diner (serverless). It highlights the benefits and challenges of moving to a distributed serverless model, including the use of purpose-built data stores and the need to optimize for different access and query patterns.

Facts

- The analogy of a food truck (monolithic) versus a sit-down diner (serverless) is used to illustrate the shift from traditional to serverless architectures.
- In a food truck, one entity handles all tasks, while in a sit-down diner, specialized roles exist for various tasks.
- Serverless architecture involves decomposing applications into smaller, interconnected components, akin to the diner's specialized roles.
- Benefits of serverless include the use of purpose-built data stores, such as NoSQL databases, in-memory caches, and time series data, based on specific data requirements.
- Serverless architectures allow optimization for different access and query patterns, offering choices like relational databases and in-memory caches to cater to various needs.
- Scalability is improved in serverless as databases can be scaled independently, based on load and location.
- Challenges include dealing with eventual consistency in distributed systems, distributed transactions, and handling partial completions in multi-service workflows.
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes may be required to manage redundant data storage in multiple locations to meet specific application requirements.
