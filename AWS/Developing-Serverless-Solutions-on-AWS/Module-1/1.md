**Summary**

In this video module, the presenter discusses various aspects of building modern serverless applications, including event-driven design, purpose-built data stores, specialized services for integration, automation using code, and practical challenges associated with serverless development. Additionally, the module contrasts monolith applications with serverless applications and provides guidance on selecting a serverless learning project.


Facts

- The module introduces the concept of thinking like a serverless application developer.
- It emphasizes the importance of decomposing applications into smaller, loosely joined services.
- Serverless applications involve working with purpose-built data stores and specialized services for integration.
- Automation through coding is highlighted as a means to facilitate deployment in a serverless environment.
- Practical challenges in serverless development include organizational structure, defining service boundaries, handling distributed data and transactions, managing numerous deployment components, and monitoring and troubleshooting in a distributed architecture.
- The module contrasts monolith applications (easier before it's harder) with serverless applications (harder before it's easier) in terms of scalability, maintenance, and ease of upgrades.
- The presenter suggests finding a suitable serverless learning project, focusing on common use cases, experimenting, and aiming for production deployment while being open to architectural changes.
