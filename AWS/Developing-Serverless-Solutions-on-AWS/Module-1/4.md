Summary

This module provides a brief introduction to various AWS services that can be used to build a serverless architecture. It emphasizes best practices for serverless applications, including decoupled event-driven patterns, serverless compute using AWS Lambda, purpose-built serverless data stores, managed services for service integrations, deployment frameworks for infrastructure as code, and creating asynchronous workflows through event routing systems, queues, and streams.

Facts

- The module introduces key AWS services for building serverless architectures.
- API Gateway is used to host REST APIs and route requests to AWS Lambda for serverless compute.
- EventBridge is discussed as a platform for writing events that are delivered to multiple subscribers, facilitating event-driven communication.
- Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a queue service for writing and consuming messages, providing a way to manage message-based communication.
- SNS (Simple Notification Service) is mentioned for notifications, enabling multiple subscribers to receive messages via topics.
- Kinesis is introduced as a service for ingesting high volumes of data with low latency, useful for streaming data.
- Best practices for serverless applications include using decoupled event-driven patterns for integration, leveraging AWS Lambda for serverless compute, selecting purpose-built serverless data stores, using managed services for service integrations, adopting deployment frameworks for infrastructure as code, and creating asynchronous workflows through event routing systems, queues, and streams.
- Asynchronous workflows in an event-driven architecture involve events triggering processing in multiple services without the need for immediate request-response interactions.

- ![Amazon API Gateway Amazon API Gateway is a synchronous event source and is well suited to be the front door to your application. You might need synchronous connections if: • A client requires a synchronous response. • You need to direct how the response comes back. • You need transactional boundaries. • You need the absolutely lowest latency. • The message flows within a single service's bounded context. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-1-4-image2.png)



- ![AWS Lambda Lambda provides serverless compute, ana IS where your business logic lives. • Lambda functions run based on an event source and receive data through the event object. • Lambda functions produce events that other services can consume. • Lambda has native support for events that AWS messaging and streaming services produce. These integrations can handle communication between services so you can connect things without knowledge of the service APIs. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-1-4-image3.png)



- ![Amazon EventBridge and Amazon SNS You can use Amazon EventBridge and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) for messaging and fan-out: • EventBridge is an event router that can abstract producers from consumers and filter events using rules. • Amazon SNS is a pub/sub service that can filter notifications to subscribers. • Both services are asynchronous event sources for Lambda and can be Lambda targets. Both provide built-in error handling. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-1-4-image4.png)



- ![Amazon SQS Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) can queue requests to prevent a service from becoming overwhelmed. It provides a durable store for events. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-1-4-image5.png)



- ![Kinesis Data Streams Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a streaming event source for Lambda. A common use case is data processing, where the stream contains data about upstream events. For example, send events that impact inventory to Kinesis Data Streams, and analyze inventory to dynamically offer discounts in the afternoons. ](../../../media/AWS-Developing-Serverless-Solutions-on-AWS-Module-1-4-image6.png)
