first step is to have an odd number of servers instead of an even number of servers

the leader should be get vote for majority of service





and the those majority service must contain at least one server that was in the previous majority that is any two majorities overlap in at least one server





so the new leader is guaranteed to know about the term number used by the previous leader, so there will be no split brain issue























[contents of logs]{.mark}



I'm gonna write out log entries for each of the servers, ~~sort of aligned to indicate slots~~ (corresponding) each slots in the log and the values I'm going to write here are the term numbers rather than client operations





Raft 2



[election restriction]{.mark}



sophisticated election restriction that the request vote handling RPC handling code is supposed to check before it says yes, before votes yes for a different peer and the rule is we only vote you, vote yes for some candidate who send us over request votes only if candidate has a higher term in the last log entry or same last term







how to back up faster a little bit better and the general idea is to be able to have the follower send enough information to the leader can jump back an entire

terms, worth of entries that have to be deleted per append entries ,so it leader may only have to send one in append entries per term in which the leader and follower disagree instead of one per entry





35



Figure two this three items only three items are persistent so that's the [log entries, current term ,and voted for.]{.mark}



why log has to be persisted is that we have to persist the application state so only the logins and so when the server restarts the only information available to reconstruct the application state is the sequence of commands in the log



what about current term why does current term have to be persistent.



they're both about ensuring that there's only one that each term has at most one leader, so yeah so voted for the



if a server receives a vote request and votes for server 1 and then it crashes and if it didn't persist. this the identity of who had voted for and in my crash we start get another vote request for the same term from server 2 and say gosh I haven't voted for anybody because my voted for is blank. now I'm gonna vote for server 2 and now. our servers voted for server 1 and for server 2 in the same term and that might allow two servers since both server and server to voted for themselves, they both may think they have a majority out of three and they're both going to become leader



the reason that's important is that writing stuff to disk is can be very expensive.



if you want it to build a system they could serve more than a hundred quests per second then there's a bunch of options, one is you can use a solid-state drive or some kind of flash



if you're even more sophisticated maybe you can build yourself "battery backed DRAM" and do the persistence into battery back DRAM and then if the server reboots hope that reboot was took shorter than the amount of time the battery lasts and that this stuff you persisted is still in the RAM







the other trick people play a lot is to try to batch . That is if you can if client requests are if you have a lot of client requests coming in, maybe you should accept a lot of them and not reply to any of them for a little bit. We call a lot of them accumulate



and then persist you know a hundred log entries at a time from your hundred

clients and you know only then send out the append entries .because you do actually have to persist this stuff to disk ,if you receive a client request you have to persist the new entry to disk before you send the append entries RPCs the followers, the leader it's essentially promising to commit that that request and can't forget about it





the followers have to persist the new log entry to their disk before they reply to the append entries because they were apply to the append entries it's also a promise to preserve and eventually commit that log entry so they can't be allowed to forget about it if they crash



it's worth



scratching your head a little bit about



why commit index lasts apply next index



and match index why it's fair game for



them to be simply thrown away if the



server crashes and restarts like why



wasn't you know commit index or last



apply it like geez last applied is the



record of how much we've executed right



if we throw that away aren't we gonna



execute log entries twice and is that



correct how about that why is why is it



safe to throw away last applied



yes I am we're all about simplicity and



safety here with raft so that's exactly



correct the the reason why all that



other stuff can be non-volatile as you



mentioned I mean sorry volatile the



reason why those other fields can be



volatile and thrown away is that we can



the leader can reconstruct sort of



what's been committed by inspecting its



own log and by the results of append



entries that it sends out to the



followers I mean initially the leader if



it if everybody restarts because they



experienced a power failure



initially the leader does not know



what's committed what's executed but



when it sends out log and append entries



it'll sort of gather back information



and essentially from the followers about



What's in how much of their logs match



the leaders and therefore how much must



have been committed before the crash



another thing in the 4-2 world which is



not the real world



another thing about figure two is that



figure two assumes that the application



state is destroyed and thrown away if



there's a crash in a restart so the



figure two world assumes that while log



is persistent that the application state



is absolutely not persistent required



not to be consistent in figure 2 because



the in figure 2 the log is preserved



persisted from the very beginning of the



system and so what's going to happen if



you sort of play out what the various



rules in figure 2 after a leader restart



is that the leader will eventually re



execute every single log entry that is



handed to the application you know



starting with log entry one after a



reboot it's the raft is gonna hand the



application every log entry starting



from one and so that will after a



restart the application will completely



reconstruct its state from scratch by a



replay from the beginning of the time of



the entire log after each restart and



again that's like a sort of



straightforward elegant plan but



obviously potentially very slow





[snapshot and log compaction]{.mark}





if we just follow the figure 2 rules the log just keeps on growing may end up you know millions and millions of entries long and so requires a lot of memory to store

the log looks like

![`= 1 ë„£=7 ](../media/Systems-Design-Fundamentals-Raft---leader-election-image1.png){width="5.0in" height="2.048611111111111in"}









when raft feels that it's log has gotten to be too large you know more than a

megabyte or ten megabytes or whatever some arbitrary limit raft will ask the

application to take make a snapshot of it the application state as of a certain

point in the log



then we can safely throw away the log before that point , the snap is basically

the table it's just about a database server,



we also need to annotate the snapshot with the entry number that are corresponds to you so it's basically you know if the entries are 1 2 3 this snapshot corresponds to,just after log

index 3 ,with the snapshot in hand, if we persist it to disk rats persistent to disk raft never again will need this part of the logs and it can simply throw it away as long as it persists a

snapshot as of a certain log index plus the log after that index as long as that's persisted to disk,we never going to need to log before that and so this is what raft does the raft ask the application for snapshot gets the snapshot saves it to disk with the log after that it just throws away this log here

![](../media/Systems-Design-Fundamentals-Raft---leader-election-image2.png){width="5.0in" height="2.8958333333333335in"}



what happens on a restart, so the raft will find the latest (snapshot -log pair) on its disk and hand the snapshot to the application because we no longer are able to replay you know all the log entries so there must be some other way to initialize the application basically,

not only is the application have to be able to produce a snapshot of application state but it has to be able to absorb a previously made snapshot and sort of reconstruct it

stable in memory from a snapshot





for the follower, leader will send its current snapshot plus current log well send its current snapshot to the follower and then presumably immediately follow it with an append entries that has the leaders current log







of X - 2 and then after it the read of X



it yields - and this this read of X of 1



if we assume that the X didn't already



have the value 1 there there must be in



this relationship and that is the read



must come after the right and this read



also must become for this right and



maybe there's some other restrictions -



anyway we can take these we can take



this set of arrows and flatten it out



into an order and that actually works so



the order that's the total order that



demonstrates that this history is



linearizable is first the right of x - 1



then the read of x yielding 1 then the



right of x - 2 and the read of x that



yields 2



alright so the fact that there is this



order that does obey the ordering



constraints shows that this history is



linearize ability and doesn't you know



if we're worried about the system that



produced this history whether it's a but



that system is linearizable then this



particular example we saw it doesn't



contradict the presumption that the



system is linearizable any questions



about what I just did each read sees you



know read of X the value it sees must be



them value written by the most the most



recent proceeding right in the order so



you know in this case in this case we're



totally ok with this order because this



read the value it saw is indeed the



value written by the most recent write



in this order and this read the value it



sighs I mean in informally it's that



reads can't real should not be yielding



stale data if I write something in Rita



back gosh I should see the value I wrote



and that's like a formalization of the



notion that



oh yes oh yeah yeah all right let me let



me he's right up example that's not



indeed linearizable so example two let's



suppose our history is we had a right of



X value one right back with value two



and so this one we also want to write



out the arrows and so we know what the



constraints are on any total order we



might find the right of X to one because



of time because it finished in real time



before the right x to started and must



come before in any satisfying order we



produce the right of Ecsta two has to



come before the right before the read of



X that yields two so we have this arrow



the read of X had to finished before the



read of X to one started so we have this



arrow and the read of X to one because



it saw value one has to come after the



right of X - 1 and more crucially before



the right of X 2 - right so we can't



have this read of X yielding one if it's



immediately preceded by I'll write out X



- 2 so we also have this arrow like this



and because there's a cycle in these



constraints there's no order that can



obey all these constraints and therefore



this history is not linearizable and so



the system that produced it is



is not a linearizable system you know



would be linearizable the history was



missing any one of these three and I



would break the cycle yes maybe I'm not



sure because suppose or I don't know how



to incorporate very strange things like



supposing somebody red 27 you know it



doesn't really if there's no right of 27



a read of 27 doesn't at least the way



I've written out the rules doesn't sort



of well there may be some sort of anti



dependency that you would construct okay



um I will continue this discussion next



week
