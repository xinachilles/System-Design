# FrontEnd Service Summary

## Overview

FrontEnd is a lightweight web service responsible for: request validation, authentication and authorization, SSL termination, server-side encryption, caching, throttling, request dispatching, deduplication, and usage data collection.

## Key Responsibilities

When a request lands on the host, the first component that picks it up is a Reverse Proxy.

A reverse proxy is a lightweight server responsible for several things

### Core Functions
- **Request Validation**: Validates incoming requests before processing
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Handles user authentication and access control
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Decrypts HTTPS requests and encrypts responses
- **Server-side Encryption**: Provides additional data encryption
- **Caching**: Implements local caching to reduce backend calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls request frequency to prevent overload
- **Request Dispatching**: Routes requests to appropriate backend services
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate request processing
- **Usage Data Collection**: Gathers metrics and analytics data
- properly handle FrontEnd service slowness: We may return the HTTP 503 status code (which is service unavailable) if the FrontEnd service becomes slow or completely unavailable.

### Additional Features
- **Compression**: Compresses responses (e.g., gzip) to reduce bandwidth
- **Error Handling**: Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 503 for service unavailability)
- **Logging**: Records service health, exceptions, and audit information
- **Metrics**: Emits key-value data for monitoring and statistics

## Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logging agents handle data processing, keeping FrontEnd service lightweight
- **Scalability**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
- **Reliability**: Multiple data center deployment ensures high availability
- **Performance**: Caching and compression optimize response times
