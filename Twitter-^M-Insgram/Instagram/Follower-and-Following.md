![Followers vs. Following Definition Defining these terms may seem silly, but new users to Instagram have a huge learning curve, so we'll go through the basics. Followers on Instagram are the users that follow you; these followers can see your posts on both your profile and on their feed. If your Instagram is set to private, these are the only people who can see your posts. They can also view your Instagram stories and send you direct messages. Following refers to the list of users that you ollow on Instagram; these users' posts appear on your feed, and you have access to view their profile if you want. You can direct message these users, but if they do not follow you back they may have to approve the message before responding. ](../../media/Twitter-^M-Insgram-Instagram-Follower-and-Following-image1.png){width="10.083333333333334in" height="5.052083333333333in"}
